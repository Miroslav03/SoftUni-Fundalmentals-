1.	Echo Type
Write a JS function that takes one parameter and prints on two lines the type of the parameter and then one of the following:
•	If the parameter type is either string or number, print its value
•	Otherwise, print the text 'Parameter is not suitable for printing'

2.	Concatenate Names
Write a function, which receives two names as string parameters and a delimiter. Print the names joined by the delimiter.

3. You will receive 3 parameters (string, char, string).
The first string will be a word with a missing char replaced with an underscore '_'.
You have to replace the missing character (underscore) of the first string with the character passed as the second parameter and compare the result with the second string.
If they are equals, you should print "Matched", otherwise print "Not Matched".

4. You will receive 3 numbers. Your task is to find their sum and print result to the console in the following format:
`{sum} - {type of the number (Integer or Float)}`

5. Write a function, which as input will receive a number.
Check and print if it is amazing or not into the following format: 
	"{number} Amazing? {True or False}"
An amazing number includes the digit 9 the sum of its digits. 
Examples for amazing numbers are 1233 (1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9), 583472 (5 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 2 = 29)
