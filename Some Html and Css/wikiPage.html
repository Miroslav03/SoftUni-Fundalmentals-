        The Brown Bear
    </h1>
    <p>
        The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America. In North <br>
        America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak <br>
        Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order<br>
        Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable <br>
        in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, <br>
        the Himalayas, China, Canada, the United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, Finland, the Balkans, the Picos de<br>
        Europa and the Carpathian region (especially Romania), Iran, Anatolia, and the Caucasus. The brown bear is<br>
        recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries.<br>
